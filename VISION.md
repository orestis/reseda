# Vision

Reseda started out as a catch-all proejct to explore various web-related domains as a small, decomposed problems. Examples include:

* [State & Reactivity](doc/state-reactivity.md)
* Changing state
* Event-based architecture
* Side-effects (IO/timeouts/etc)
* Routing, code-splitting, [Suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#suspense) & [Render-as-you-fetch](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html#approach-3-render-as-you-fetch-using-suspense)

With the goal being to provide one library per problem. The libraries should be composable with each other to build bespoke frameworks (a la carte). Perhaps a natural framework will also arise from all this work, perhaps not.
